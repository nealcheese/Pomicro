Code for timer sorted
Add functionality for switching between work states
	1. Add start time for each work state into an array or call start time for the current work state
	2. Add start/stop and skip buttons - skip button moves to next work state
	3. At end of work state automatically move to next work state
	
Change timer to scheduled executor service - seems to be much better
